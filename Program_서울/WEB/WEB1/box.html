    <h1>Trade coins</h1> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_coin">coins</a> minted by a government, but
    not necessarily legal tender within the territory of the issuing country. These quasi-bullion coins (in rarer cases
    small change) were thus actually export goods that is, bullion in the form of coins, used for the bulk purchase of
    important goods from other countries, where they could be bought at a favourable price, compared to the purchasing
    power of the same amount of bullion within the trade coins' country of origin.
